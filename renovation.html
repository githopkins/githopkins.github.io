			<h3>Renovation Loans</h3>
			<p>A Renovation Loan gives homeowners access to the money they need to fix up their new or existing homes. These loans can come in the form of mortgages with built-in fixer-upper funding or personal loans. In some cases, they allow homebuyers and homeowners to finance both the purchase or refinance along with the renovation of a home through a single mortgage. Renovation loans may cover home improvements such as installing or updating heating and cooling systems, waterproofing, mold remediation, new additions, or any other updates that could add value to the house.</p>

			<h3>Standard FHA 203k</h3>
			<p>The Standard FHA 203k allows for home buyers and homeowners to renovate their house while financing it into their mortgage. This can be done with a new home purchase as well as a refinance of an existing home. Renovation possibilities with this product include adding new appliances, replacing a septic system, building a new level, and most other home improvement projects imaginable.</p>
			<h3>FHA Limited</h3>
			<p>The FHA Limited 203(k) Rehabilitation Loan is intended for smaller scale projects that are not structural in nature. This program can help a buyer or homeowner remodel a kitchen, change the flooring, or install an outdoor deck, adding to their own enjoyment of the home and adding to its value at the same time.</p>
			<h3>VA Renovation</h3>
			<p>The VA Renovation is designed for minor renovations through either new home purchase or refinance. This loan allows a veteran to use their benefits to roll the cost of renovation into the mortgage without putting any money down!</p>
			<h3>Fannie Mae HomeStyle</h3>
			<p>The Fannie Mae HomeStyle is a renovation loan that can be used on new home purchase as well as refinance. It is like the FHA 203k, but it allows for renovations of luxury items where the FHA 203k does not. Luxury items can include basketball courts, swimming pools, sauna, and more. A HomeStyle can also be used for second homes, unlike a FHA 203k.</p>
