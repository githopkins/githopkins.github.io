					<h5>Bryan Primiani</h5>
					<span><strong>Branch Manager</strong>
						<strong>New Jersey</strong></span>
					<p>The company greatly understands its employees, referral partners, and clients. Everyone at AnnieMac strives to meet closing dates as a team. Past companies it was always Ops against Sales. At Annie Mac its not that way. By closing dates being meet, its helps loan officers obtain and continue to work with many referral partners and clients which in many cases become lifelong relationships.</p>

						<strong>Florida</strong></span>
					<p>We are one of the few companies I know that offer dedicated recruiting support to branch managers who want to grow. In just two short years I have added 9 producing loan officers to my branch due to this support… No way that happens if I’m not at AnnieMac and trying to recruit on my own.</p>
