			<h2><span>About Us.</span></h2>
			<h4>The Basics</h4>
			<p>AnnieMac Home Mortgage, a d/b/a of American Neighborhood Mortgage Acceptance Company, LLC, is a nationwide mortgage loan provider dedicated to the principle of providing MORE products, services support and value to clients, partners and the community. Headquartered in Mount Laurel, N.J with branches throughout the United States, we&rsquo;ve emerged as one of the fastest-growing home lenders in the industry.</p>
			<h5>Do you want MORE from your mortgage company?</h5>
			<h4>We Provide More For Our Customers</h4>
			<p>We set the industry standard for customer service, quality and integrity while providing an innovative lending and servicing platform that allows our borrowers to responsibly experience the benefits of homeownership. Borrowers are more than a number to us, so we work with them to get them approved for the loans they want. Our client&rsquo;s need for a smooth and speedy process is our priority, so we&rsquo;ve developed a customer-friendly processing and closing system that gets them into their dream home quickly with no hiccups.</p>
			<p>As an approved seller/servicer with Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae, we have access to the best loan programs available, including conventional, government and non-conforming mortgages. By providing more loan options than the industry standard, we can provide borrowers with options that will truly fit their needs for the long haul.</p>
			<p>Additionally, our processing and underwriting are handled completed in-house, which means our clients can expect quick processing, white-glove customer service and 24-7 access to updates and information via our interactive Mobile app.</p>
			<h4>We Provide More For Our Team</h4>
			<p>Since day one, our company has operated with the understanding that our most valuable resource is the skill, knowledge and hard work of our employees and realtor partners, both at our home base and our affiliated branches spread throughout the country. Their success is our success, so our mission is to empower them with the very best tools, knowledge and support possible.</p>
			<p>AnnieMac Worx, for instance, is a masterclass in the finer point of real estate sales, featuring certification opportunities and an always-updating selection of live and on-demand lessons designed to keep participants ahead of upcoming industry trends. By offering invaluable programs like this to our team and realtor partners, long-lasting partnerships that benefit everyone are formed.</p>
			<p>Our team also gets the full support of AnnieMac&rsquo;s marketing team to promote them in their markets, including fully-automated marketing campaigns that handles outreach so you can reap the rewards. From a premium social media presence and optimized SEO searchability to personalized fliers, business cards and other materials, our goal is to make everyone we work with a sales superstar.</p>
			<p>With all of these amazing features (and a whole lot more), it&rsquo;s no wonder that AnnieMac is continually recognized during Awards Season by the industry&rsquo;s most respected publications (everyone from the Philadelphia Business Journal to Thebestandbrightest.com) as one of the best companies to work for in the country.</p>
			<h4>We Provide More For Our Community</h4>
			<p>At AnnieMac, helping borrowers buy or renovate their dream home is our everyday mission&hellip; but for us, that simply isn&rsquo;t enough. As a company that thrives on making connections with people, businesses, and the world around us, we believe that it is our duty and pleasure to support our communities far and wide.</p>
			<p>We&rsquo;re not shy about it either. Our Annual &ldquo;Fetch The Ball&rdquo; Golf Tournament, benefitting Freedom Service Dogs of America, is proudly publicized and open to employees, partners and the general public so we can raise money to help provide trained service dogs for those with disabilities. Our volunteer work with NJ&rsquo;s Cathedral Kitchen helps provide food for those in need, and we also work with quality charities like Toys for Tots and Habitat for Humanity throughout the year.</p>
			<p>We don&rsquo;t neglect our own community, either. The AnnieMac &ldquo;Culture Club&rdquo;, made up entirely of volunteers from our team, works tirelessly to create fun events that brings us closer together as a family. Not only do these activities foster a strong bond among us, but many also help raise funds for our Sunshine Fund, which was created to financially help fellow AnnieMac members in need.</p>
